#1
make parts and have them be craftable by a custom workbench that changes blockstates depending on weather it's "empty" or has a preset.
after that, make an elaborate and cool way to combine those parts into a single creation

#2
JETPACKS. PLEASE. AND LET THEM HAVE BAUBLES SUPPORT

#3
modular shields that support all the ores

#4
modular bows that have special string effects, for example, a nether material sets mobs on fire

#5
different parts of the tool add stats in a different way.
the mining/hitting part adds the mining level, efficiency, and attack damage.
the base of the tool adds the durability, some efficiency and attack damage.
the handle adds the attack speed
the grip/extra adds an affix

#6
the hammer can be shift + right clicked to flip it and deal damage/mine with the opposite side

#7
either make the item system really in depth or make everything fit together using already existing items/materials.
aka: make them as modded as possible, or make them closer to vanilla
like, instead of blades and heads and such, it'll be plates or ingots
instead of a specialized handle for different types of weapons, just use rods/sticks
for something heavy like the hammer, use entire blocks
those are just a few examples, and it'll remove the entire middle ground in the process and make it so everything is more streamlined and understandable
...
its a more boring way of doing things, and I would have to take a few "artistic liberties", but it can be beneficial to me, and the users
OR
I can make a few specialized parts, and share them among (AMONG US) themselves
